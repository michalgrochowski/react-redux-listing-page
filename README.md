### A simple product list with two dropdowns to filter them, built in React + Redux.***

Packages used:
- React (and React DOM),
- Redux,
- React-redux,
- node-sass-chokidar,
- npm-run-all,

after cloning or downloading repo run `npm install` in your command line, and then `npm start` to fire up a dev server. Running `npm run build` will make a nice production build.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
